[Verse]
N.C.
Long gone the days of summer
N.C.
In L.A. it stretches longer
(with Riff 1)
D
Fading, waiting
D
Try to heal but the pain it won’t go
D
Start with less always seems to cost more
D
Hating, breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
(with Riff 2)
D
Remember, come December, one day can last forever
C                    G                   D
Ain’t nowhere that’s safe for a lowly pretender
C            G                       D
I’m shooting straight for the target center

[Chorus]
F                G
Maybe you should know
            Am             C 
I’m feeling lonely and I’m tired, oh yeah
F              G 
Maybe I should go
         Am      C 
Got no desire to watch the last tear fall
F               G 
Maybe this will show
             Am           C 
I’m reeling, empty, uninspired, oh yeah
F             G 
Maybe I don’t know
       Am             C 
You anymore and I’m smiling
D               F
Our burden is untied
G      Am
Let it die

[Verse]
N.C.
I’d be lying if I said it felt right
N.C.
Even though I got a dog in this fight
(with Riff 1)
D
Wounded, losing
D
People talk, in and out the words go
D
To be the one from where the wind it does blow
D
Hounded, surrounded

[Pre-Chorus]
(with Riff 2)
D
Remember, come December, one day can last forever
C                    G                   D

C            G                       D

Got no desire to watch the last tear fall

Our burden is untied

Let it die
